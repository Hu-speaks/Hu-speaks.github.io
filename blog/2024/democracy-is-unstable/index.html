It seems that, when the US tries to implement democracies in other less well-developed countries, there is hardly any success. Sure, several counterexamples come to mind, like post-war Japan, south Korea, and Taiwan. But we also have Vietnam, Cuba, and Afghanistan, and the failure over these countries cannot be attributed to a lack of effort by the US government. So what went wrong over there? Is there any reason why some countries can adopt a functional democracy and prosper, while for others this seems almost impossible? Yes, different countries have different cultures and histories, and sometimes the mind of the incidental leader of a country can make or break a democracy. However, if we zoom out to look at the big picture, democracy as a way of ruling a country seems to have an inherent problem: compared with dictatorship, it is simple unstable.</p> <p>It may be more enlightening if I talk about stability in the most general term possible. For any system, either made of inanimate objects or made of human beings, stability means a tendency for this system to bounce back to its original state when subject to some kind of disturbance. This is also called negative feedback. Biologists would say that a living human body is stable (or at least metastable), since it has many negative feedback mechanisms to push the human body system back to normal if it deviates from it. The premise, which is true in most cases, is that the world is riddled with noises and disturbances. The natural conclusion, then, is that, for any system to exist long term, it has to be stable (or at least metastable). Talking in technical terms of stability isn’t too helpful when considering the problem of democracy, since it is near impossible to build a mathematical model for it. But what we can do is to revert the logic a bit: if something exists in nature for a long time, then more likely than not, it has to be stable.</p> <p>So what’s the problem? Democracies in the US have existed for at least 200 years, which is long enough time for anyone to regard it as strong evidence for the stability of democracy. I agree that, in the absence of an existential war (by that I mean blood-spilling, nasty wars happening on the homeland, not foreign wars from a distance or cold wars), democracy seems to be stable. But no country is founded without an existential war. the Peoples’ republic of China is founded on a civil war, the US is founded on the revolutionary war, and South Korea is founded on the Korea war, etc. In order to win this founding war, the winning side has to have a strong leader who can exert total control the military as well as citizens. An actual democracy is too slow and scattered to be able to win this war. Even ancient Rome knows this idea.</p> <p>Now, after this founding war is won, the winning side is naturally a dictatorship, which has a pyramid structure where one man directly controls a bunch of other men, and each of those men directly controls a bunch of lower-rank men, and so on. The top man, George Washington in the case of US, and Mao in the case of China, enjoys limitless power. It is nothing short of a miracle for this man to willingly relinquish this power. To do so is to directly oppose one’s human nature, and arguable no moral teachings can provide a surefire way to guarantee this to happen. This is not the end of the story though, because the power vacuum caused by the top man stepping down invites new conflicts. This conflict would be in the frameworks of democracy, in other words, an election. Nonetheless, it is still a power struggle, and the side with better control of the subsidiaries would tend to win this struggle. So how can you guarantee that this new leader who is elected democratically, does not aim to enjoy this power forever? Maybe this leader will not do this because of their own conscience, or can’t do this because of rules and guardrails of democracy, but what about the next successor? The next next successor?</p> <p>Eventually, the rules and guardrails will age, and people’s adherence to democratic values fluctuate. This is, in my opinion, the fundamental issue raised by Trump. He exposes the fact that democracies will always run into the stability issue, and the result will always be uncertain.</p> <p>Another clear example of the issue of stability is the Nazi Germany. Before Nazis rose to power, Germany is a democracy. But (arguably) the German people decides that they are bigger issue to face than preserving democracy; they need to restore Germany to its former glory more than they need democracy. So, as the result, democracy is gone.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we, the human race, have not cracked the code of democracy. This is simply no surefire way to establish one from scratch. This is even no surefire way to preserve a democracy. A democratic regime is always sliding, ever so slightly, from its perfect equilibrium, and no matter how much effort we put into pushing it back to normal, there is always the possibility that it all crumbles down. Maybe next year. Maybe tomorrow.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">More from Peter
