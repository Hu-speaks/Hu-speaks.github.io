Hello there! Peter Hu speaking. I am a second-generation immigrant who spent his childhood in China. 

Why this blog? Simply put, there is not a lot of effective communications happening between the native Chinese and western people, particularly folks in the US. From what I see, the Chinese government tries to improve its image by outputting a large amount of propaganda, but they are utterly ineffective. In a sense, some people parrots these propaganda not for the western audience, but for the domestic Chinese audience, in order to show them that they "tell the Chinese story well". But the truth is they are not telling it well at all! China's image in the western population is steadily declining. What's more, these propaganda blocks the proper channels where people communicates, overwhelming any voice that is more intended to the English-speaking audience. As a result, people completely tune out any voice from China.

Don't get me wrong, I am not here to "tell the Chinese story well" either. I am here to talk about China in a more theoretical framework, about which it means for a country so drastically different from liberal democracies to exist in the present moment, and what it says about us, people who live elsewhere. I also don't care about painting a bad image to CCP; go to Fox news for that. I want to tell the Chinese story as is; to tell the truth and my honest opinion. After all, this is the point of communication, isn't it?
